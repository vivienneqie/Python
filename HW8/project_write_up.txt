We worked on the homework assignment together, using only this semester's course materials.

Part 1
The frame fades in to see Princess Peach dancing happily in a field. The first scene then fades into the second in which Bowser appears 
and chases after Princess Peach. Bowser captures her and the screen shakes. The scene fades into the next which has a red tint showing 
the kidnapped Princess Peach taken to Bowser’s Castle. The scene fades out and into the next scene, which shows Mario appearing in 
Bowser’s Castle. Mario fights bowser and defeats him. The scene fades out and into the next in which Mario is reunited with Princess Peach. 
The last frame is then pushed off to the right, making room for the credits to roll. 

Part 2
In filmingCode, a robot is programed to take a certain number of pictures for each individual scene. The pictures are then saved as a jpg. In 
actingCode, a robot is programmed to move and interact with props. The robot also pauses to allow another robot enough time to take a picture. 
In editingCode, the pictures that were taken in filmingCode are edited and appended to masterList, which includes all of the pictures for each 
scene. The pictures in masterList are saved as individual pictures named output_video_pic_#.jpg, with # indicating the frame number in the movie. 
The user is then given the option of either saving each frame in masterList as a jpg or creating a single gif from masterList. In performanceCode, 
the pictures saved as output_video_pic_#.jpg are shown to the user.
