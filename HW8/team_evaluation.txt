In my group, I filmed the movie and wrote the filmingCode and the actingCode.
Nathan was put into our group late, so he put together the editingCode and performanceCode, and also edited the movie using iMovie.
Amy helped me with writing the filmingCode and she also wrote the project_write_up.txt file.
In my opinion, I feel that Nathan and I equally did 35 percent and Amy did 30 percent. I feel that we worked well as a team.
